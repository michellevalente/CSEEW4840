Lab 1

This assignment goal is to add functionality that allows a user to display and edit the contents of a 16 Ã—
8 bit ram using the FPGA.

Lab 2

This code implements an Internet-based chat client on this platform. When a user types a line
of text on the attached usb keyboard, it will appear on the video display. When s/he presses
Enter, the contents of the line should be sent through the Ethernet port to a chat server we
have running on the SoCKit board network we have running in the lab, which will then
broadcast it to all the other connected chat clients
